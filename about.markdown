My name is Qianci Yang. I was trained as a mathematician at University of Warwick. Now I am a doctoral researcher at Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology, working with Prof. Dr. Arne Traulsen and Dr. Philipp Altrock. Our work focuses on quantification of tumor phenotypic and immunologic heterogeneity, on immune system interactions during cellular immunotherapy, and on nonlinear models of selection in cancer systems.
